    "- Note that the ranges of variables are very different. For the lines to fit onto the same chart, all variables should be *normalized* to the range of one variable (for example, if you choose the leftmost variable---year---to be the reference, all other variables should be normalized to range between 2015 and 2023).\n",
    "- Make sure you first draw the axes, and only then normalize variables to the reference, and then draw.\n",
    "- You may find it useful to loop over all observations (rows) and `.plot()` each line individually.\n",
    "- Note that since we are plotting each line individually, matplotlib will not generate a legend. Refer to [the documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/custom_legends.html. ) for guidance on how to create a custom legend."
