    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will create an interactive visualization using Vega-Altair that has two linked views:\n",
    "1. A calendar-like heatmap (day x month) of average number of avalanches by date, and\n",
    "2. A bar chart of total avalanche count by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chart requirements:\n",
    " - The bar chart should display the counts across all dates by default, but should be filtered to only the selected date (or dates) by clicking on the heatmap. \n",
    " - When hovering over a date, a tooltip should appear with the date and the value (average number of avalanches on that date).\n",

    "\n",

    "- Similar to HW 2, you will need to create a data set with *all valid dates*, not only those that appear in the data. We need to account for zeros!\n",

    "\n",
    "For this assignment we are recreating the Bubble Chart from Homework 3 but this time using exclusively Vega-Altair. \n",

    "A refresher on the requirements:\n",
    "- Each `Discipline` bubble and label should be colored according to the `Sport` variable. You can pick your own colors, as long as they are discernable.\n",
    "- Each bubble's size should depend on the number of gold medals awarded. (This can be calculated as the number of unique `Event`-`Gender` pairs in the data set.)\n",
    "- There should be a label noting that 1940 and 1944 Olympic games were not held (due to World War II).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus additional requirement:\n",
    "- When hovering over a bubble, a tooltip with all the underlying data should appear.\n",

    "![A bubble grid chart of medals for winter olympics](bubble_chart.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are giving you the code necessary to prepare the data set, since you have done that already for HW3. This is primarily an exercise in precise formatting using Vega-Altair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- Notice that we converted the `Year` variable to a datetime. Think about how you can leverage that in your encoding.\n",
    "- There is a variety of ways to create an annotation box. One way to do it is to create a \"dummy\" DataFrame that you use to `.encode()` your `.mark_rect()` and `.mark_text()`. Another could be to use the `alt.datum()` command (see https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encodings/index.html#datum-and-value).\n",
